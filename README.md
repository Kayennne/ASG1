PROJECT NAME
This page is about a game called Overwatch. This webpage should give users more information about the basics of the game such as the different maps, different heroes, and the Overwatch League teams and its members

DESIGN PROCESS
This website is for users that want to know more about the game and what the game offers

1. As a user, I would want to know more about the maps of the game and how diverse it can be
2. As a user, I would want to know the playable characters in the game that I can use
3. As a user, I would like to know about who are the players playing in the Overwatch League

FEATURES
Existing features:
Feature 1 - the navigation bar at the top allows users to navigate between the 3 pages

Feature 2 - picture slider, enables users to see multiple pictures without taking up much space

Feature 3 - socials handle allows users to easily access the social media handles of the game

Feature 4 - picture links that lead to another page, telling users more about the Overwatch League teams

Features left to implement:
Feature 1 - a hover effect to show extra information about a picture button

Feature 2 - YouTube links to show more relevant information to the game

TECHNOLOGIES USED
Tools and languages used to code this website was CSS, JavaScript and HTML
HTML - codes the content wanted in the website
CSS - helps in designing the layouts of the code in html
JavaScript - helps with things like animation (the slideshows)

Extensions used was

1. Prettier - checks indentation when saving
2. Live server - runs the code
3. ES Lint
4. HTML CSS Support -You can view a list of id and class

TESTING
In terms of testing how the website works on different screens such as mobile and laptop, the laptop mostly shows content side by side, for example pictures on the left and text on the right etc.
Whereas in the mobile view, the contents are all in a line, for example the picture on top, then the text below

Some problems I faced in the testing was that certain pictures when using slideshow in the heroes page changes size when swiping, the forward button also does not work properly, but the backwards button works fine
